Hi everyone! Welcome to our GitHub link for CPSC 6300. 
The overall goal of this project was to use the data found in the Religious Landscape Study (RLS) to answer the question: Do people who identify themselves with a certain political party align with the classical party views or are their views more influenced by their education or socioeconomic status? 

After cleaning the dataset by removing any rows with null variables, we utilized the political party, income level, and education level information to create three visuals. The first visual, top half, is a force directed scatterplot showing respondent's answers to "divisive" questions and political. The second visual, bottom left, is a Sankey plot showing political party and income level. The third plot, bottom right, is a Sunburst plot showing education level and political party. 

Please feel free to click around any of the plots and try to find some trends. 

Thank you for your time!
